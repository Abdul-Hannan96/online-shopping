    "text": "🛍️ Summary:\nThis project explores how online shopping behavior predicts whether someone completes a purchase.\nWe used data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, collected by the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering at Gazi University (2018). The goal? To uncover which behaviors — like product page views, bounce rates, and session duration — actually signal a shopper is likely to buy.\n🧪 We modeled purchase behavior using a logistic regression, where the outcome was whether a person made a purchase (yes or no).\nKey predictors in our model:\n🔎 Product Pages Viewed\n⏳ Time Spent on Site\n🚪 Bounce Rate (leaving the site quickly)\n💡 Insight: People who view more product pages are about 35% more likely to make a purchase — even after accounting for time spent on the site and whether they bounced (with a margin of error of ±3%)."
